# NVAN X-Plane Command Aliases Plugin
This is a simple plugin that makes aliases for commands that are "push and hold" so you can use them via the native X-Plane UDP API.

## Installation
Download the [latest version here](https://github.com/nvan/x-plane-command-aliases-plugin/releases).

Just extract and drop the plugin into `X-Plane/Resources/plugins` folder.

Then in the `commands.txt` file, write the commands you want aliases to be made for one per line.
You can place comments with `#`.

```txt
# Sample commands.txt file

# A couple commands for Fire Panel of Toliss A321
AirbusFBW/FireTestENG1
AirbusFBW/FireTestENG2
AirbusFBW/FireTestAPU

# Another sample of native planes
sim/flight_controls/pitch_trim_up
sim/flight_controls/pitch_trim_down
sim/flight_controls/rudder_trim_left
sim/flight_controls/rudder_trim_right
```

Three aliases will be created for each command:
- A dataref `COMMAND_press` if set to 1 will begin the command / if set to 0 will stop it.
- A command `COMMAND_begin` that will begin the command.
- A command `COMMAND_end` that will stop it.

Examples for `AirbusFBW/FireTestENG1`:
- `AirbusFBW/FireTestENG1_press`
- `AirbusFBW/FireTestENG1_begin`
- `AirbusFBW/FireTestENG1_end`
